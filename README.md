Black jack game

A game of cards where you get to draw two random cards between 1 and 13

-When 1 is drawn , you get 11 points.
-When 11,12 or 13 is drawn, you get 10 points.
If none of these two conditions are met, you get what you draw(2-10)

If the sum of the two cards is less than 21, you get a chance to draw another card.

If the sum of the all drawn cards is 21. You have Black Jack!!!!

If the sum of the drawn cards is greater than 21, you have lost the game.
